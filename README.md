This project provides Python code for BJT and MOSFET bias configuration. The code calculates bias points for both BJT and MOSFET transistors.

# Overview

This project contains two primary sections, each dealing with a different type of transistor:

### BJT Bias Configuration

In the BJT section, you will find code for biasing a Bipolar Junction Transistor in the common emitter configuration. The code allows you to input values for Vcc, beta (Î²), and IB (base current) and calculates the bias configurations for fixed, emitter feedback, and collector feedback.

### MOSFET Bias Configuration

In the MOSFET section, you will find code for biasing a depletion-type MOSFET. The code allows you to input values for Vdd (drain supply voltage) and Vds (drain-source voltage) and calculates the bias configurations for fixed bias and voltage divider bias.

## Usage

1. Run the Python code using a compatible Python interpreter.
2. Follow the prompts to input the required parameters for each section (Vcc, beta, IB, Vdd, Vds, resistors, etc.).
3. The code will calculate the bias configurations and display the results for each biasing scheme.
